### Section 2 - Powers

The Arbiters shall be the final authority on the constitutionality of the actions of the government. If a Reddit Congressman believes an act of congress is unconstitutional they may submit their case to the Arbiters. If one of the Arbiters accepts the case a Reddit Thread will be opened and each side will be given 7 days to state their case and arguments. After arguments close the Arbiters will be given 2 days to deliberate and return a verdict. For a verdict to be binding, two of the three Arbiters must agree to it. Arbiters shall have the power to permaban any Reddit user that has received a temporary ban from two congressmen within the last 2 days.  The decision to permaban a Reddit user must be publicly justified by reference to a relevant Reddit Congress Law. The decision to permaban may be overturned by the other two Arbiters in agreement.
