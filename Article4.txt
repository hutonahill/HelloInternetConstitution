Article 4 - Census
        it shall be the responsibility of the Reddit Congress to establish a Census to be taken by recording the Reddit usernames and country of origin of Tims who send in paper ballets. A record of all the Tims that voted and what their vote was in the last election shall be kept and remain public. The list of voters shall be used to create a restricted subreddit used only for the conducting of Congressional campaigns, polls conducted by the Reddit Congress, and Special Elections. A Tim who believes their vote was not counted or received may apply to join the restricted subreddit, but they must be hosted by a congressman and at least 3 other Tims and must provide some kind of proof that the vote was sent, a receipt, a photo of the vote and some kind of date and time, or the ability to pick their vote out of the official vote-counting video.
